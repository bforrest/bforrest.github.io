      <description>Born in Vermont, Barry grew up outside Orlando, Florida. He actually did work for a “Mickey Mouse” outfit during high school as a &amp;ldquo;Food &amp;amp; Beverage Host&amp;rdquo; in Fantasy Land of the Magic Kingdom.
Barry is a fan of automobile racing in many flavors. He also enjoys wondering aimlessly, accompanied by Silvia, through wooded areas or parched deserts, pointing a camera at wild critters, bees, birds and anything else that may catch their eye.</description>
