      <description>Finding brews to keep everyone happy is no small feat. Care and feeding of the twin kegerators&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;} at the Dallas Improving office has been my side job for about six years. Yes, I&amp;rsquo;ve done extensive market research. I&amp;rsquo;ve met many people who are passionate about their products, community, and profession. The depth of involvement and connection within the brewing community is amazing.
In June, I attended Ken Grossman&amp;rsquo;s keynote talk, &amp;ldquo;Lessons Iâ€™ve Learned in 50 Years of Brewing&amp;rdquo;, at Home Brew Con 2018.</description>

      <description>To make a really long and detailed story short: I brewed the home version of this delicious beer to help out with the fund raising. It will be on tap at the Improving Dallas office starting on January 10th. Here&amp;rsquo;s the link to a GoFundMe which feeds directly into the fund created by Sierra Nevada.
