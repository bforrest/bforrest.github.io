      <description>Once a month I get a little reminder that I need to go pay my e*Trade credit card bill. Every month for as long as I can remember I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to use their user interface to pay off my current balance and been told by an error dialog that my selection is not valid.
I have clearly selected a frequency of &amp;ldquo;One Time&amp;rdquo; and not &amp;ldquo;Once a Month&amp;rdquo; as the dialog box indicates.</description>

      <description>My current assingment for Improvinghas me writing much more client-side javascript. I&amp;rsquo;m not a javascript ninja, so I lean on the console window to confirm that the script is doing what I expected it to do. This approach works great until I view a page in IE, which has no clue what &amp;ldquo;console&amp;rdquo; means and acosts me with script error popups.
This finally got annoying enough that I started looking for a universal solution.</description>
