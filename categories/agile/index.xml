      <description>During an interview for Agile for Humans, Ryan asked me about parallels between agile and brewing. At the time I mostly blew it off. My thinking then was that the feedback loop was too long and the inspection bit was a tad too fuzzy. Ultimately there is a link with the inspection and adaptation.
In my short home brewing arch, there have been many experiments. Most of them have worked, but a few have them haven&amp;rsquo;t been so stellar.</description>

      <description>What happens when an agile CTI coach gets bored and knows someone that they believe has something to contribute to the agile software community? You basically get invited to co-present a conference talk, a helping hand to find your voice, plus an opportunity to start sharing your experience and point of view with others.
Some time has passed and the memory has faded, so forgive me if I don&amp;rsquo;t get this exactly right in the telling of the story.</description>
