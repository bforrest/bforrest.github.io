      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve picked up a few badges via CoderWall and I wanted to include them on the blog with the rest of the information in the right side column.

I wanted to have the same functionality for my own html pages, so I started digging around. Looking at the page source, I saw an include for &amp;ldquo;/js/application.</description>
