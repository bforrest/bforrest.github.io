      <description>During an interview for Agile for Humans, Ryan asked me about parallels between agile and brewing. At the time I mostly blew it off. My thinking then was that the feedback loop was too long and the inspection bit was a tad too fuzzy. Ultimately there is a link with the inspection and adaptation.
In my short home brewing arch, there have been many experiments. Most of them have worked, but a few have them haven&amp;rsquo;t been so stellar.</description>
