      <description>I spent some time over the weekend dragging along old posts from my tumblr blog that deal with programming. I didn&amp;rsquo;t bother with the instagram pictures or the four square checkins. After a few failed attempts to get the tumblr posts where the were suposed to be, I opted to stash them in a working directory and move them by hand.
Now all of my &amp;lt;scarcasm&amp;gt;glorious code related posts&amp;lt;/sarcasm&amp;gt; are in one place, it&amp;rsquo;s time to dust up some posts about my shiny new play things Twitter Bootstrap Octopress and Markdown.</description>
